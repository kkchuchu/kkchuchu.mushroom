=== Vim Usage ===
    * <Leader> - \
    * :dw - delete a word
    * :edit - refresh file
    * zM zR - fold all
    * zm zr - fold level by level

=== Multiple Cursors ===

Out of the box, all you need to know is a single key Ctrl-n. Pressing the key in Normal mode highlights the current word under the cursor in Visual mode and places a virtual cursor at the end of it. Pressing it again finds the next occurrence and places another virtual cursor at the end of the visual selection.
If you select multiple lines in Visual mode, pressing the key puts a virtual cursor at every line and leaves you in Normal mode.

After you've marked all your locations with Ctrl-n, you can change the visual selection with normal Vim motion commands in Visual mode. You could go to Normal mode by pressing v and wield your motion commands there. Single key command to switch to Insert mode such as c or s from Visual mode or i, a, I, A in Normal mode should work without any issues.

=== Trouble Shooting ===
    * Is not an "editor command‚Äù
        - meaning it's not an Ex command. That is, you wouldn't type :zz. "Command" is an overloaded term in Vim.
